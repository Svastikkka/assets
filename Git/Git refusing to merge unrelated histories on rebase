Problem:- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37937984/git-refusing-to-merge-unrelated-histories-on-rebase)

During git rebase origin/development the following error message is shown from Git:

```
fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
Error redoing merge 1234deadbeef1234deadbeef
```
My Git version is 2.9.0. It used to work fine in the previous version.

How can I continue this rebase allowing unrelated histories with the forced flag introduced in the new release?


```
git pull origin branchname --allow-unrelated-histories

```

"git merge" used to allow merging two branches that have no common base by default, which led to a brand new history of an existing project created and then get pulled by an unsuspecting maintainer, which allowed an unnecessary parallel history merged into the existing project. The command has been taught not to allow this by default, with an escape hatch --allow-unrelated-histories option to be used in a rare event that merges histories of two projects that started their lives independently.
